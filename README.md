# Asus X450CA 

[![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/macOS-Big%20Sur%2011.6.5-red&logo=apple)](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/)
[![OpenCore](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCore-0.7.6-blue)](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg)

NOTICE: **This OpenCore EFI files does not have a SMBIOS. Generate and add your smbios (MacBookAir6,2) with the [GenSMBIOS tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS).**
## What's Working?
- Boot
- Hardware Acceleration
- Audio Input & Output
- USB 3.0 Mapping
- WebCam
- Brightness Control
- Trackpad (Settings accessible with battery installed)
- Ethernet 
- HDMI Port, _with audio Output!_
- iServices (**WITH PROPER SMBIOS CONFIGURATION.**)
- Headphone Jack
- USB Tethering with [HoRNDIS](https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/)
- sleep/wake, fn+f1 keyboard combo works too!
- WiFI
- ~~Card Reader~~ currently not included
- VGA out (very rudimentary mirroring, nothing else)

## What Doesn't Work?
- at this point, damn near nothing

## Weird Quirks and Shit I need to fix
- Phase 1 boot is stretched, could be firmware limitation
- screen glitching at boot phase transition, non issue for me
- ~~haven't set up OC Boot Picker as i don't need it~~ done
- ~~USB 3.0 Mapping~~ DONE
- fn key support is available with [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
- pressing fn+f8 (Projector button thing) on lock screen, or w/o Karabiner-Elements **COMPLETELY SHITS YOUR DISPLAY, DO NOT RECCOMEND.**
- Playing DRM-Controlled movies on safari, Apple TV+ app is not possible, oc limitation. use firefox/chrome

## BIOS Settings
- DVMT-PRE-ALLOC: 64M

## How to actually install macOS Big Sur?
- acquire files
  - macOS Recovery Files with macrecovery.py (found in `utilities` folder)
  - EFI files
- appropriate installation medium (refer to "Creating the USB" part on [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/))
- copy in files
- Create SMBIOS data for MacBookAir6,2 with GenSMBIOS (found in `utilities` folder)
  - make sure that the s/n is not [registered](https://checkcoverage.apple.com)
- fill in SMBIOS data on PlatformInfo/Generic
- example of SMBIOS data and where to fill it in

- boot computer, spam esc, select `(UEFI) flashdisk name`
- computer should boot into macOS recovery
- make sure you have ethernet
- nuke hard disk, install macos
- computer would reboot a few times during reboot, choose `macOS Installer`
- finish installation, then use mountEFI to well, "mount efi"
- copy EFI files into local hard disk, remove anything inside in the process
- reboot into BIOS, add Boot Option with the path `\EFI\OC\OpenCore.efi`
- **don't forget to save your changes**
- boot (hopefully) into macOS
- install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for fn key functionality, and rebind opt to cmd and vice versa
